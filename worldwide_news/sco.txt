A fire that tore through an old school building on Saturday is being treated as suspicious.

Midlothian Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service are investigating the fire at the disused Paradykes Primary School building in Mayburn Walk, Loan head.

The fire has caused extensive damage to the building.

Emergency Services were called to the building around 9.40pm on Saturday 4 after reports that it was well ablaze.

The Fire and Rescue Service extinguished the fire, which police say is now being treated as suspicious.

A number of youths were believed to have been seen nearby around about the same time the fire was started and police are looking to trace anyone who was in the vicinity.

Door to door enquiries are being carried out and CCTV footage which covers the area is being sought and viewed in a bid to establish what happened.

Inspector Neil Mitchell at Dalkeith Police Station said "We have information that a number of youths were seen in the area near to the building prior to the fire starting.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have been nearby and saw any youths at the building or have information relating to the fire to call us.

"We are also keen to hear from anyone who may have their own CCTV system in or around the area of Mayburn Walk to get in touch."
